# VCF Form Demo

- Virtual Career Fair registration demo generalized from my previous work experience.
- Form validations enabled on some screens as demonstration, disabled in others to move quicker through step wizard
- Multiple separate libraries (`react-hook-form, react-select, react-datepicker`) were "unified" in style and behavior for a consistent form look and feel

## Highlights

- This is a [Astro](https://astro.build/) app deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for that strong typing goodness
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for [Utility-First CSS](https://frontstuff.io/in-defense-of-utility-first-css)
- [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/) for near real-time deduped data-fetching
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for delightful form validation
- [React Select](https://react-select.com/home) for powerful, flexible dropdowns
- [React Datepicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/) for powerful, customizable date pickers

## Getting Started
